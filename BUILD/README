Scalable Bayesian Rule List library.

This distribution contains the source code distribution to build a library and
test executable for the construction of scalable bayesian rule lists. The
library contains functions to train a model (train) and make predictions
using the model (predict). It also contains a rule list library for manipulating
rule lists.

The executable, sbrlmod, is a test program that exercises the rule library
as well as the training and prediction.
