This directory is here simply to build the distribution.
The distribution builds:

	* Both static and dynamic libraries
	* A statically linked executable testprog_static
	* A dynamically linked executable testprog
	* The tic-tac-toe testing and training data.

How to build a distribution:

1. Create links to the files from the source code that we need:

ln -s ../*.[ch] .
ln -s ../ttt_test.* .
ln -s ../ttt_train.* .

2. Now, build the distribution:
sh rr
make dist

This will create sbrlmod-VERSION.tar.gz

3. After you've created a distribution and moved it somewhere, the cleanup
script will remove all the build process files leaving you a clean directory.
