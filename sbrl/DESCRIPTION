Description: An efficient implementation of Scalable Bayesian Rule Lists Algorithm, a competitor algorithm for decision tree algorithms; see Hongyu Yang, Cynthia Rudin, Margo Seltzer (2017) <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/yang17h.html>. It builds from pre-mined association rules and have a logical structure identical to a decision list or one-sided decision tree. Fully optimized over rule lists, this algorithm strikes practical balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational speed.
